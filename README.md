# chibi
URL shortener with private API without public interface. Ideal for marketing campaigns on own domain when you don't want to rely on 3rd party.


## Installation

Create database
```bash
psql -d postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE chibi;"
python manage.py migrate
```

Create superuser
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Run server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
Now open you browser on `127.0.0.1:8000/secret/admin/`. This admin url was chosen because 
`secret/admin` redirects to `secret/admin/` but `admin` to `admin/` doesn't.

## API

On endpoint `api/shorten/` is shortening API service.
API token can be created in admin interface. 

Example of authorization header:
```
Authorization: Token S2ScvIRPayx7zBIfCV25Mv3Ak1popRBKJZeKMHJzQfR1x0OZ9k
```

Payload:
```json
{"url":"https://skra.cz?utm_source=githoub.com&utm_campaign=chibi-repo", "slug": "github"}
```
Response is the same as request. `slug` is not required. In case `slug` is missing, it is generated automatically.
